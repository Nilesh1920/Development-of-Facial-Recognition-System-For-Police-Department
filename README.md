# Facial Recognition System for Police Department

## 📌 Project Overview
This **Facial Recognition System** is an AI-powered model designed to assist law enforcement agencies in identifying and tracking criminals using real-time face dataset images. The system employs deep learning techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency in suspect recognition, reducing manual efforts in criminal investigations.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Facial Recognition**: Identifies individuals from live video feeds or uploaded images.
- **AI & Machine Learning Algorithms**: Utilizes **Decision Tree, FaceNet, VGG16, and Random Forest** for enhanced accuracy.
- **Automated Criminal Identification**: Compares facial features against a criminal database.
- **Secure & Scalable**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **High Accuracy & Speed**: Optimized for real-world law enforcement applications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - OpenCV
  - TensorFlow / Keras
  - Scikit-learn
  - NumPy & Pandas
- **Database**: MySQL / Firebase (Optional for Storing Facial Data)
- **Deployment**: Google Colab / Local Machine
